#  Twittermenti
An exercise I learned in Udemy that gives a sentiment emoji according to the text inputted by the user. A CoreML model is used to identify positive, neutral, or negative sentiment from the text given by the user.

# What I Learned
- Using swifter to extract tweets
- Incorporating CoreML Model 
- Using SwiftyJSON to parse JSON
- Accessing plist in the view controller to retrieve secret values like APIs.. and then ignored by way of .gitignore
